# `ploteria`

![Continuous integration](https://github.com/ploteria/ploteria/workflows/Continuous%20integration/badge.svg)

This crate allows you to easily crate complex plots and graphs. Internally this crate uses
[gnuplot] to perform the actual plotting.

This crate was originally an implementation detail of [Criterion.rs], but it has since
been forked into its own crate.
